The glass resonates at a particular frequency, which depends on the shape and mass of the glass, and you hear a resounding ‘ting’ sound. What is going on? Your tapping force initiates many different vibrations within the glass. Some of these vibrations have a wavelength (§1.8.5) that equals the dimensions of the glass. The vibrations at these particular wavelengths are reinforced, while other non-matching vibrations are attenuated. Thus, resonance within the glass amplifies some frequencies and attenuates other frequencies. The amplified frequencies are termed ‘resonant frequencies’ or ‘natural frequencies’. The primary resonant frequency, which is amplified the most, is also termed the ‘eigen’ frequency of the resonating object. Very quickly, the non-resonant frequencies are dampened out, and the glass vibrates at its resonant frequency (or frequencies). Thus the vibrating glass constitutes a sound source, the sound propagates in the surrounding air, and we hear a ‘ping’ sound. The envelope (§@(sec:envelope)) of this ‘ping’ sound depends on the material (composition), mass, and shape of the vibrating object. Almost all physical bodies have a tendency to vibrate at their natural frequencies: not only a glass but also a pendulum, a swing, a bridge, all musical instruments, a rope on a flagpole (Minnaert 1970, vol. 2, sec. 61), the column of air in an organ pipe, the volume of air in a concert hall or venue – and, importantly, also the body of air in the human vocal tract. As a first approximation, let us consider a simple straight tube, uniform in diameter, filled with air of 37°C, with a sound source at one end. This is an idealization of e.g. an organ pipe, a flute, or of a human speaker producing a continuous schwa vowel /ə/. (It differs somewhat from a concert hall, in that the tube is open at one end.) The principle of resonance is explained by Christian Huygens as follows (in a letter in November 1693): “Because every sound, or rather noise, which is repeated in equal and very small intervals, produces a [periodic] musical tone; similarly the length of an organ pipe determines its [resonant] tone, because the vibrations of air arrive at small intervals of time which are equal to the time which [the vibrations] need to move back and forth through the length of the organ pipe, as it is closed at one end.” (Huygens 1905, 10:571, transl. HQ) The natural frequencies resonate (are amplified) because their wavelength matches the length \\(L\\) of the tube: the compressions and rarefactions of one period coincide with those of the next period in time, so that the amplitude of the pressure variations increases for the resonant frequencies: the resonant frequencies are amplified and other frequencies are attenuated. Thus the tube acts as a bandpass filter (albeit different from the one illustrated in Fig.??). 5.2 Formants The natural frequencies of a tube of length \\(L\\) are \\[F_n = \\frac{2n-1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{c}{L}\\] where \\(n\\) is the ranking number of the natural frequency, \\(c\\) is the speed of sound, 353 m/s (§1.4), and \\(L\\) is the length of the tube (Stevens 1998, 139) 1. If we assume that the vocal tract of an adult female speaker has length \\(L=0.15\\) m, then the first resonant frequency of this speaker’s vocal tract is at \\(F_1 = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{353}{0.15} = 588\\ \\textrm{Hz}\\). In reality, the natural frequency is slightly lower (due to absorption and radiation, both of which are outside the scope of this introductory text) at \\(F_1 \\approx 550\\ \\textrm{Hz}\\). Similarly, her \\(F_2 \\approx 1650\\ \\textrm{Hz}\\) and \\(F_3 \\approx 2750\\ \\textrm{Hz}\\). The natural frequencies of the tube are termed its formants (by Ludimar Hermann, 1838–1914)2. In the spectrum of the /i/ vowel in Fig.5.1, we see that harmonics are amplified around formants \\(F_1 \\approx 350\\ \\textrm{Hz}\\) and \\(F_2 \\approx 2700\\ \\textrm{Hz}\\); this formant pattern characterizes the vowel /i/.

## Preface

### Aims

In this tutorial you will learn about acoustics, phonetics, and speech analysis. 
You will learn the core concepts in these related fields, as well as the necessary practical skills. 
The aim of this tutorial is to provide you with the phonetic insights and skills that you need to conduct phonetic research in your own project (e.g. paper or thesis). 

### How to use this tutorial 

You will learn the most from this tutorial if you (1) read the explanatory texts in this tutorial, (2) work through the questions and exercises provided, (3) practice in applying your new knowledge with the `Praat` computer program (detailed below), and (4) re-read the relevant sections from this tutorial and your textbook (with the help of keywords provided per section). 

### Recommended software

In this tutorial you will work mostly with `Praat`. This is a popular open-source program for the analysis of speech, developed by Paul Boersma and David Weenink (Universiteit van Amsterdam). It can be downloaded from its own website <www.praat.org>, where you may also find lots of useful documentation. `Praat` also has extensive `Help` built in. 

#### Installing `Praat`

REVISE 

In order to get Praat on your computer, go to http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat > Download praat (choose the version for your operative system). It will take a second to download the program, either by downloading the self extracting executable file and double clicking on it or by downloading the ZIP file (and double clicking on it). In both ways, a Praat or Praat.exe file will appear, which is the Praat program itself. It is handy to make a shortcut link of Praat to an easily accessible location on your computer, for instance on the desktop (in Windows, click on praat.exe with the right mouse botton > Send to > Desktop, or click on right click on the desktop > New > Shortcut > Browse to find the Praat file). There is also a Praat user list (http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/praat-users/), where people share their knowledge posting questions and answers.

### Recommended textbooks

This tutorial is intended to be used in addition to one or more textbook(s) in Phonetics, to which this tutorial will provide additional background knowledge. Some excellent textbooks in Phonetics are those by 
Ladefoged & Johnson, Reetz & Jongman, Rietveld & Van Heuven [in Dutch] AND MORE. Zsiga

This tutorial is divided into XX parts:

- basics of acoustics

- bac
It is divided into 5 modules: basics of acoustics 1 and 2, spectrograms, LPC and PSOLA, which are, in turn, split up into different paragraphs (see index below). Every module is made of theoretical parts and of excercises (with answers in separate documents). It is useful to go through the excercises, as welll, in order to check your understanding, and because the answers are sometimes complementary to the explanations. Every module is also made up of a practical part, where you will learn how to work with Praat. Praat  is an open-source program for the analysis of speech, developed by Paul Boersma and David Weenink (Universiteit van Amsterdam).

In order to get Praat on your computer, go to http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat > Download praat (choose the version for your operative system). It will take a second to download the program, either by downloading the self extracting executable file and double clicking on it or by downloading the ZIP file (and double clicking on it).

### Further reading

## Using Praat

The aim of this tutorial is to explain how to work with speech: how to perform phonetic analyses, and how to record speech so that the recording is suitable for phonetic analyses.

## Overview {#sec:ADCoverview}

In order to process sounds by means of a computer program, or telephone, we first need to convert that sound, the variations in air pressure, to numbers that are then further processed by a computer or by a telephone device. This is a two-step process, involving at least two key components in order:

(1) the **microphone**: this device transforms variations in air pressure into matching variations in an electrical signal. The microphone has a thin membrane, and displacements of the membrane (caused by the sound pressure wave hitting the membrane) are transformed into proportional fluctuations in electric current (Ampere), electric voltage (Volt) or electric resistance (Ohm), depending on the design of the microphone. For instructions about how to handle a microphone, see the text box in ยง\@ref(sec:microphone)) below. 
The analog electrical signal is then passed on from the microphone to...

(2) the **analog-to-digital-converter** (ADC): this device converts a continuous, analog electrical signal into a stream of discrete, digital numbers. The ADC measures the input signal, and reports the digital output value of that input signal. This process is also called 'sampling'. Sampling a signal is done with a certain 'sampling frequency' (number of measurements per second) and with a certain precision of measurement (known as 'amplitude resolution'), both explained below. The result is an output stream of digital numbers (in bytes), to be handled further by computer software (e.g. to be displayed, compressed, transmitted, stored, played back, etc.)^[The input signal to be sampled often comes from a microphone, but other signals may also be sampled, e.g. the signal coming from an electro-encephalogram (EEG) electrode.] ^[In a speaker's telephone, the stream of numbers (output from the ADC) constitutes the input for subsequent processing and data compression, even before speech data are transmitted to the receiving phone.]

Very soon, whenever you want to hear sound from a computer or from a telephone connection, you will also need 

(3) a **digital-to-analog-converter** (DAC): this device converts a stream of discrete, digital numbers into a continuous analog electrical signal, with a pre-specified conversion frequency and amplitude precision. The result is an output analog electrical signal, to be handled further by audio hardware (e.g. to be amplified, sent to a loudspeaker, etc.)

## How to handle a microphone {#sec:microphone}

- A good microphone is a very sensitive and very expensive device. Treat it with great care. Never blow into a microphone (it's far better to just say `test` or `check` or anything with plosive and fricative consonants). Do not tap on its surface. 

- Do not plug or unplug the microphone into/from a "hot" port (first set the port's input/output volume to zero, then plug/unplug). 

- Do not speak *into* the microphone, but just over it or alongside. The microphone should measure sounds, but *not* the flow of air coming out of a speaker's mouth and nose. If the microphone comes with a foam cap to dampen airflow, then use it. 

- Do not touch the microphone while it is working; this will result in undesired (and often loud) contact sounds in the output signal.

## Key parameters in AD conversion

The digital signal obtained by analog-to-digital conversion is an approximation of the original (analog) sound. Two key parameters determine the accuracy of the digital approximation, and thus the quality of the digital sound recording. The first parameter is the number of samples taken per second: the *sampling frequency*, and the number of bits used to describe the amplitude value of the sample: the *amplitude resolution*. These are explained below. 

### Sampling frequency {#sec:samplingfrequency}

The sampling frequency (symbol $f_s$) is the frequency with which digital samples are taken and stored from the original analog sound. With a higher sampling frequency, the digital signal better (more closely) approximates the analog source in the time dimension, resulting in a better digital recording. The sampling frequency is expressed in samples per second, in Hertz units (cf. ยง\@ref(sec:frequency)). A sampling frequency of 2 kHz (2000 Hz) means that the sound is sampled $2000 \times$ per second. 

::: {#nyquist .warningbox}

The sampling frequency $f_s$ must be at least $2 \times$ the highest frequency $f$ in the analog source sound. This means that the source sound may not contain any (sounds with) frequencies above $f_s / 2$, the so-called 'nyquist frequency'. In practice this is guaranteed by high-pass filtering the source sound, thus removing any components with frequencies higher than the nyquist frequency, before AD conversion. This filtering is routinely done by the AD and DA conversion hardware and software. 

> TODO add crossref to filtering section 

For speech, most acoustic information is contained in the frequency range up to 8 kHz. Given the previous paragraph, this means that we need a sampling frequency of at least 16 kHz^[This is the typical sampling frequency in VoIP, "wideband speech".] or higher. In most phonetic projects, the most relevant phonetic information is contained in the frequency range up to 16 kHz, for which a sampling frequency of $f_s = 32$ kHz^[This is the standard sampling frequency for FM radio.] is adequate. 
For music, relevant information may be contained in the full audible range up to 22 kHz, and the standard sampling frequency is 44.1 kHz^[This is the standard sampling frequency for audio CDs.]. 

- Check the sampling frequency before making a digital recording, set it to an appropriate value, write down the sampling frequency in your lab journal, and mention it in your report.  

- Using a higher sampling frequencies will result in proportionally larger digital sound files, which require longer processing times and more computer storage.

### Amplitude resolution

The amplitude resolution, or quantization, refers to the number of separate steps in amplitude (voltage) that are discerned during sampling. Again, with a higher amplitude resolution, the digital signal better (more closely) approximates the analog source in the amplitude dimension, resulting in a better digital recording. The amplitude resolution is expressed in bits^[1 bit or binary digit is a single digit in the binary system. A binary digit can only have 2 possible values, $0$ or $1$ (just as a decimal digit can have 10 possible values, $0$ to $9$).] or bytes^[1 byte is 8 bits, or $2^8=256$ possible values.].

The recorded amplitude values are discrete, and because of the "jump" from one discrete amplitude step to the next-higher or next-lower value, the amplitude values are "rounded" to some extent. This rounding or quantization results in audible noise in the digital signal. This rounding noise amounts to half a step of possible amplitude values. If we have more amplitude values (higher amplitude resolution) then the rounding off becomes less noticeable^[Notice that one bit is required to record the sign of the value (positive or negative), so with 1 byte of resolution we can in principle record 256 possible amplitude values, running from -128 to +128, with rounding noise having an amplitude of $0.5/128$ or $1/256$ of the maximum amplitude. This corresponds to a signal-to-quantization-noise ratio of 50 dB. In practice, however, amplitude values are not stored as integer numbers but as floating numbers.].

In phonetics, the most common amplitude resolution is 16 bits, or $2^{16} = 65536$ different amplitude steps^[This is also the standard amplitude resolution for audio CDs.]. The quantization noise has an amplitude of $1/65636$ of the maximum amplitude; this corresponds to a signal-to-quantization-noise ratio of about 98 dB. This small amount of rounding noise is negligible. 

## How to record a sound

For any audio recording, there are a few essential precautions that you'll have to attend to, to obtain high-quality recordings suitable for subsequent analysis and re-distribution. 

::: {#recording .warningbox}

### Remove non-target sounds 

In order to obtain a high-quality recording, it helps to attenuate all non-target sounds, in various ways:

- If available, use a sound-attenuating cabin or booth. The booth will help to insulate your target signal from unwanted other sounds. Close the door of the booth properly. Leave non-essential equipment (watches, phones) outside the booth. \
If a booth is not available, then find the quietest space available. Try using thick curtains, carpets, and cushions, and other sound-dampening materials, to improve your recording. Make lots of test recordings, listen critically, and attempt phonetic analyses before you proceed with your recordings. \
Background: Phonetic analyses, in particular formant measurements, aim at finding frequencies in the speech signal that may be related to the speaker's articulations. However, similar frequencies may also arise from acoustic reflections in the recording room, and it may be difficult or impossible to disentangle these two kinds of frequency properties. Hence it helps to minimize any acoustic reflections in the recording room^[Frequency measurements may be suspect if the corresponding wavelength is a multiple of one of the dimensions of the room; or if the reported frequency is below 100 Hz; or if the reliability of the frequency measurement is low. ].

> TODO crossref formants. 


- Under noisy circumstances, try using a directional microphone, which attenuates sounds not coming straight (from the source) but from the sides (including reflections and non-target sounds). 

- Switch off any non-essential equipment, and try to attenuate non-target sounds from elsewhere. Even if you cannot hear a difference, the equipment sounds and outside sounds may interfere with the target sound signal, resulting in unwanted artefacts. 

- Despite all these precautions, outside sounds may still interfere. This happens in particular with low-frequency signals, e.g. due to traffic outside, elevators elsewhere in the building, and so forth. These interfering sounds are typically outside the frequency range of speech. Therefore we can easily remove them, by high-pass filtering the target speech signal, *before* DA conversion. 
  - Use a high-pass filter that will discard frequencies below a certain cut-off frequency. 
  - Set the cut-off frequency well below the lowest possible frequency (component) in your target sound, say, a cutoff frequency of about 60 Hz.

### Check recording level {#sec:recordinglevel}

**During your recording, check the level of the recording**. \
If the recording level is too low, then the target signal is too weak, andthe background noise (including quantization noise) is relatively strong. It's very difficult or impossible to fix the signal-to-noise ratio later, so you need to **fix this now**, during the recording. \
If the recording level is too high, then the loudest portions of the target signal will be too strong, leading to "clipping" or distortion. It is impossible to fix this later, so you need to **fix this now**, during the recording. \
There are several ways to adjust the level of the recording: 
  - by adjusting the level of the input channel (maybe called `Gain`), in your computer settings, 
  - by varying the distance from the sound source to the microphone (in general: the closer the better, but also depending on the type of microphone),
  - in speech: by instructing the speaker to speak more loudly or more softly. 


### Avoid lossy audio formats {#sec:avoidlossyformats}

It it tempting to record sounds digitally on smart devices which store lots of audio in compressed (lossy) formats such as MP3 or MP4. However, the lossy compression of audio data may lead to difficulties in subsequent phonetic analyses. The results may sound quite right to your ears, but  details in timing or in spectral details may nevertheless have been lost in the compression. It depends on your interests and your research questions whether or not this constitutes a problem. 
For phonetic research, it is generally better to record in 'lossless' audio formats that do not compress the audio data, rather than in 'lossy' formats. Check whether and how your smart device can make lossless recordings: if possible at all, this will probably require a deep dive into the settings on the recording device.

### On your computer, using Praat

We assume that you use a computer equipped with a **microphone**, or with an analog **input port** for an analog signal coming from an external microphone. If using an external microphone, plug it into your computer (see ยง\@ref(sec:microphone)). Check that audio input is arriving in your computer, using your Windows or Mac OSX system settings for sound input (if using an external microphone, select the appropriate channel). 

::: {#box-praatrecord .praatbox}

- In the Praat Objects window, select `New > Record mono sound`.
In most situations it is not necessary to record stereo sounds. 

- Choose the appropriate sampling frequency, e.g. 22050 Hz (see ยง\@ref(sec:samplingfrequency)). You may receive an error message if the chosen sampling frequency is incompatible with your computer. 

- Click `Record`, and speak a test sentence into the microphone, e.g. *The source of the huge river is the clear spring*^[One of the so-called Harvard test sentences, from list 3, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_sentences>. In Dutch, a popular test sentence is *Het leven is mooi als de zon schijnt*.], or make a test recording of your sound source. After testing, click `Stop`. 

- **While recording, check the level of the recording** (ยง\@ref(sec:recordinglevel)). \
In `Praat`, make sure that your recording level is in the yellow zone, with occasional peaks in the red zone, but without clipping. 

- Click `Play` to listen to your recording. **Repeat the recording** until the recording level is good. 

- Enter a name for the recording, e.g. `river`, in the lower right corner (this name will be used within `Praat`).

- Save the recording: `Save to list` (i.e., to the list of objects in the `Praat` Objects window).

Your speech recording is now an object within `Praat`. For storage, you should save this object as an audio file on your computer's hard disk.  

- To do so, in the `Praat` object window, select the Sound object that you just recorded. (Normally this new object has been added at the BOTTOM of the list of objects).

- From the top menu, choose `Save > Write to WAV file...` or choose any of the other audio formats. Save the Sound object in a folder and under an unambiguous name that you will remember and understand a year from now -- not just `river.wav`. Note in your journal the folder and filename of your sound recording. Keep projects in separate folders on your computer.  

- In order to open an audio file from your computer hard disk, from the top menu in the Objects window, choose `Open > Read from file...`, and pick the target audio file.
